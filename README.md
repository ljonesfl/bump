# bump
Command line tool for bumping project versions.

## Usage

Add a version.json file to the root of your project.<br>
Use the command line utility in build scripts to increment the version number.<br>
It supports the semver terminology of major, minor and patch.<br>

### Examples

Show current version:

    bump
    
Typing bump by itself in a directory containing a version.json file will show the 
current version on the command line.

e.g.

0.1.4

If the version contains a build number > 0 then it will show the build also.

e.g.

0.1.4 (15) 
    
#### Incrementing Version Elements

Performing an increment action reads the file, increments the requested element and writes the file back 
out. This is ideal for automated release scripts.
   
build:

    bump --build
    
patch:
    
    bump --patch
    
minor:

    bump --minor
    
major:

    bump --major
    
This will load the version file, increment the patch number and write it back out.

#### Creating a New File

    bump --new
    
Creates a new version.json file is the current folder.

## Installation

### MacOS

Download the current repository or use wget:

    wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ljonesfl/bump/master/bump

Make the file executable:

    chmod +x bump

To install the command globally:

    sudo cp bump /usr/local/bin
    
## Usage with gitflow

A useful technique for creating a release using gitflow is to use the following command
from the develop branch:

     bump | xargs git flow release start
     
 Assuming your current version is 1.2.3, this command is the equivalent of typing:
 
    git flow release start 1.2.3
    
This command can easily be added as an alias to facilitate process automation.
